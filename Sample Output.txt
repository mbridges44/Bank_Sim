According to the outputs here, it looks like adding an additional teller makes a lot of difference of not only total time for the bank, but it
cut down on customer wait time by more than half as well. Additionally, having the same number of tellers but no drive thru also cuts the total time of the bank
down pretty signifigantly as well. Though the customer wait time was not cut as much as having 4 tellers, teller idle time was cut down to about 8% from 34% which is good
if the bank manager doesn't want to pay a 4th teller and still leave customers satisfied.
